A simple calculator programmed in python 3.6.0 using the tkinter graphical module.

Can be run using 'python calculator.py' in the windows command line (requires python 3.6.0).

Using the calculator:
Type the first number, then the operand (+,-,* or /), then the second number, then press '='.
The output will be displayed on screen and can be used as the first number for the next calculation.
Use dlt to remove the last digit/operand entered and clr to clear the display.
The clr button can be also used to reset the calculator if any errors occur.

Note on negative values:
The calculator does not support the input of negative numbers.
Negative numbers can still be obtained and used via some calculations (e.g. calculating 5-6).
However, this may result in unforseen errors.
If the current output is a negative number, pressing the dlt button will reset it to zero.
